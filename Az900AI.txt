ML
  -ability to develop algorithm by itself
  -Unsupervised learning and Supervised learning

ML Model
  -is a program that can be used to recognize a pattern in data
  -can be used to predict fututre behaviours
  -can be used to categorize things
  -can be used to recognize people, objects and landmarks
  -can be used to understands speech and text model
  -you train a model
  -you evaluate a model using test data to measure how accurate is it
  -at the end deploy the model

AI Workloads
  -1. Prediction and Demand Forecasting
  -2. Anamoly Detection
  -3. Computer Vision
  -4. NLP
  -5. Conversational AI
  
Guiding Principles of AI
  -Fairness
  -Reliability and Safety
  -Privacy and Security
  -Inclusiveness
  -Transparency
  -Accountability

Machine Learning on Azure
  -Algorithms
    -Regression - finding the relationship between variables
  -Classification
    -Binary classification
    -Multi-class classification
  -Clustering
    -type of unsupervised learning
    -finds groups of related things among data
  -Feature and Labels
    -Feature is an input variable
    -When we are looking to predict a filed, it is called label
  -Training the Model
    -Split the training and validation datasets randomnly
  -Evaluate results - Regression
    -use the validation dataset to test the model
    -Mean Square Error
      -large differences are much worse than small differences
  -Evaluate results - Classification
    -result is to give a prediction score that subject is pasrt of the group
    -False Positives vs False Negatives

  Confusion Matrix
    -Classification Model
      -Actual Values and Predicted values
      -TP, FP, FN, TN
      -          Positive   Negative
       Positive    TP          FP
       Negative    FN          TN
      -Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve
      -Area under the Curve (AUC)

No Code ML
  -AutoML is a tool for this
    -Drag dataset onto designer
    -Visualize data, Exclude cloumns if not required
    -Clean rows with missing data
    -Drag training models onto the canvas
    -Once training model as all verified,Training pipeline can be converted into inference pipeline
  -Azure ML designer
    -need to pick the data model unlike auto ML
