Software Architecture & Design of Modern Large Scale Systems

System requirements and Architectural Drivers
Types of Requirements (Architectural Drivers)
  -Features of the system
    -Func req
  -Qulity Attributes
    -Non Func req
  -System Constraints
    -Limitations and boundaries

Methods of gathering requirements
  -most powerful methos
    -Use cases - situation/scenario in which our system is used
    -User flows - step by step graphical respresentation of each use case 

Requrement gathering steps
  1. Identify all the actors/users in our system
  2. Capture and describe all possible usecases / scenarios
  3. User flow - Expand each use case through flow of events

Unified Modelling Language
  -Sequence Diagram
    -interaction between actors and objects
    -Time flows from top to bottom
