Azure Function
  Run code on demand
  No management of underlying infrastructure

Triggers
  -Only one Trigger
  -have associated data which are provided as arguments

Bindings
  -can have zero bindings
  -Declarative way of connecting services/resources with az functions

Pricing Plans
  -Consumption
    -5 mins limit of execution 
    -Has free quota
    -Auto scaling
  -Premium
    -At least one warm instance to avoid cold start
    -VNet connectivity
    -Always pay for pre warmed instnce
  -App Service
    -Runs on dedicated VMs
    -Reserved onstances
    -Billing as per App service plan
    -Manual scaling

Docker Runtime
  -If we don't want to run az func in azure managed function instance we
    can use docker conntainers    

When to use?
  -good for rapid prototyping
  -can use part of monolithic apps to have scalability : use functions here
  -integrate different systems

When to not use?
  -not fit for long running processes

Function app
  -group of function
  -language is selcted here and not in each function

Functions
  -Authorization level
    -Anonymous
    -Function
      -Function key - specific to function
      -Host key - works for all functions within function app
    -Admin
      -needs special master host key which provides admin aceess to 'all'
      -can not be revoked, but can be renewed
functions
  -Route template
   -allows us to define function and to add query params if needed
  -functions.json
    -defines bindings and trigger
  -context
    -used to pass data to and from function
    -has log object
    -has trigger object
    -has binding details
  -Function invocation history
    -in Monitor
    -need to enable app insights
  -Function's Storage Account
    -used to store function code and runtime
    -use to store logs as well

host.json
  -metadata file contains global config for all functions within function app
local.settings.json
  -for local dev configs

Monitoring
  -has Invocation and Log sections
  -Need app insights enabled to see these options
  -Alerts
    -have custom alert based on condition
  -Diagnostics settings
    -collect logs/metrics and send it to destination like log analytics, storage account, stream to eventhub
  -Log stream
    -live logs used for development

Securing Azure Functions
  -Can use App Service Authentication
    -MS, google, Twitter, Facebook, anonymous
    -All or none Auth option where all functions need above Auth if configured
    -Not good for SPA
  -using APIM
    -can use AD B2C

Function proxies
  -basic routing
  -request transormation
  -additional trace and debugging info
  -good for small apps

Durable functions
  -Fan in fan out
    -final function aggregates all function results
  -Async Http API
    -used for long running functions
    -one api used to get real time status
