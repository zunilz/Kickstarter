1.	Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
2.	Each Azure region is always paired with another region within the same geography, such as US, Europe, or Asia, at least 300 miles away.
3.	Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs. Resource groups can be used to group costs, but you will not receive a separate invoice for each resource group. Management groups are used to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for subscriptions. You can set up billing profiles to roll up subscriptions into invoice sections, but this requires customization.
4.	ARM is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in an Azure subscription. You use management features, such as access control, resource locks, and resource tags, to secure and organize resources after deployment
5.	Availability zones are primarily for virtual machines, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases
6.	Virtual Machine Scale Sets are an Azure compute resource that you can use to deploy and manage and scale a set of identical virtual machines.
7.	Azure Functions allows you to run code as a service without having to manage the underlying platform or infrastructure. Azure Logic Apps is similar to Azure Functions, but uses predefined workflows instead of developing your own code.
8.	A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed to a dedicated subnet of a virtual network. You can use them to connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN connection
9.	Service endpoints are used to expose Azure services to a virtual network, providing communication between the two. ExpressRoute is used to connect an on-premises network to Azure. NSGs allow you to configure inbound and outbound rules for virtual networks and virtual machines. Peering allows you to connect virtual networks together
ExpressRoute connections and Azure VPN Gateway are two services that you can use to connect an on-premises network to Azure. Bastion provides a web interface to remotely administer Azure virtual machines by using SSH/RDP. Azure Firewall is a stateful firewall service used to protect virtual networks.
10.	Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs in the cloud. It enables your users to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices such as Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux. It works with apps that you can use to access Remote Desktops and apps. You can also use most modern browsers to access Azure Virtual Desktop-hosted experiences.
11.	Containers are a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host. Unlike virtual machines, you do not manage the operating system for a container.
12.	The Archive storage tier stores data offline and offers the lowest storage costs, but also the highest costs to rehydrate and access data. The Hot storage tier is optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently. Data in the Cool access tier can tolerate slightly lower availability, but still requires high durability, retrieval latency, and throughput characteristics similar to hot data.
13.	The Hot tier is optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently. The Cool access tier has a slightly lower availability SLA and higher access costs compared to hot data, which are acceptable trade-offs for lower storage costs. Archive storage stores data offline and offers the lowest storage costs, but also the highest costs to rehydrate and access data.
14.	Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via industry-standard SMB and NFS protocols.
15.	Azure RBAC allows you to assign a set of permissions to a user or group. Resource tags are used to locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners. Resource locks prevent the accidental change or deletion of a resource. Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing an application secrets in a single, central location.
16.	Conditional Access allows administrators to control, allow, or deny access to resources based on certain signals. You can require that access to certain applications only be allowed if the users are using an approved client application. MFA is a process whereby a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. Examples include a code on their mobile phone or a fingerprint scan
17.	Azure AD Connect syncs user identities from an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain to Azure AD. Azure AD Connect  allows you to use features such as single sign-on (SSO), MFA, and self-service password reset (SSPR) in both systems. SSPR prevents users from using known compromised passwords
18.	Usage meters, such as CPU time, disk size, and write operations, are used to calculate your bill for an Azure resource. Deleting or deallocating a resource means that you will no longer be billed for it. Different regions can have different associated prices. Resources cost the same no matter the time of day or the day of the week
19.	The TCO Calculator helps you estimate the cost savings over time of operating a solution in Azure compared to operating in an on-premises datacenter.
20.	You can use tags to categorize costs by department, such as human resources, marketing, or finance, or by environment, such as test or production. Resizing underutilized virtual machines is a good cost saving measure and provisioning resources in lower cost regions is a good practice, but resource tags do not help with this.
21.	The Azure Pricing calculator allows you to estimate and configure according to your specific requirements. You will then receive a consolidated estimated price and a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each resource you added to your solution.
22.	Azure Cost Management allows you to create and manage cost and usage budgets by monitoring resource demand trends, consumption rates, and cost patterns. It also allows you to use historical data to generate reports and forecast future usage and expenditures.
23.	Resource tags can be used to group billing data and categorize costs by runtime environment, such as billing usage for virtual machines running in a production environment.
24.	Azure Reservations offers discounted prices on certain Azure services. Azure Reservations can save you up to 72 percent compared to pay-as-you-go prices. To receive a discount, you can reserve services and resources by paying in advance. Spending limits can suspend a subscription when the spend limit is reached
25.	A resource lock prevents resources from being accidentally deleted or changed. Resource tags offer the custom grouping of resources. Policies enforce different rules across all resource configurations so that the configurations stay compliant with corporate standards. An initiative is a way of grouping related policies together.
26.	Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit resources.
27.	Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies called initiatives. Azure Policy evaluates your resources and highlights resources that are not compliant with the policies you created. Azure Policy can also prevent noncompliant resources from being created.
28.	Azure CLI is an executable program with which a user can execute commands in Bash that call the Azure REST API. Azure Cloud Shell also supports Azure PowerShell as an executable program.
29.	Azure CLI allows you to use the Bash shell to perform administrative tasks. Bash is used in Linux environments, so a Linux administrator will probably be more comfortable performing command-line administration from Azure CLI.
30.	ARM templates define an application's infrastructure requirements for a repeatable deployment that is done in a consistent manner. A validation step ensures that all resources can be created in the proper order based on dependencies, in parallel and idempotent.
31.	Azure Advisor evaluates Azure resources and makes recommendations to help improve reliability, security, and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs
32.	After an outage, Service Health provides official incident reports called root cause analysis (RCA), which you can share with stakeholders.
33.	Azure Monitor is a platform that collects metric and logging data, such as CPU percentages. The data can be used to trigger autoscaling.
34.	Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that allows you to monitor running applications, automatically detect performance anomalies, and use built-in analytics tools to see what users do on an app.
35.	In a private cloud, hardware must be purchased for start up and maintenance. In a private cloud, organizations control resources and security. Quick provisioning is a characteristic of the public cloud deployment model. Paying only for what is used is a characteristic of the public cloud deployment model.
36.	In a consumption-based model, you do not pay for anything until you start using resources, and you only pay for what you use. If you stop using a resource, you stop paying for it. High expenditures are usually associated with the purchase of the physical infrastructure, which is not needed in a consumption-based model.
37.	Cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong. You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region. Apps in cloud computing can scale vertically and horizontally. In a public cloud model, you do not get physical access to servers, as they are managed by the cloud provider.
38.	Agility means that you can deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as app requirements change. Scalability means that you can add RAM, CPU, or entire virtual machines to a configuration. Elasticity means that you can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so apps always have the resources they need. High availability means that cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.
39.	Disaster recovery uses services, such as cloud-based backup, data replication, and geo-distribution, to keep data and code safe in the event of a disaster.
40.	You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region. This is referred to as geo-distribution
41.	Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding virtual machines to the configuration. You scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine. Agility refers to the ability to deploy new applications and services quickly. High availability minimizes downtime when things go wrong.
42.	Operating systems are managed by customers when using IaaS or an on-premises deployments. The operating systems are not accessible in PaaS and SaaS deployments.
43.	IaaS helps you reduce the cost and complexity of maintaining a physical server and its datacenter infrastructure. Virtual networks are part of the IaaS cloud service
44.	If you have virtual machine workloads that are used only during certain periods, but you run them every hour of every day, then you are wasting money. These virtual machines are great candidates to deallocate when not in use and start back when required to save compute costs while the virtual machines are deallocated
45.	Azure policies will allow you to enforce company standards on new virtual machines when combined with Azure VM Image Builder and Azure Compute Gallery. By using Azure Policy and role-based access control (RBAC) assignments, enterprises can enforce standards on Azure resources. But on virtual machines, these mechanisms only affect the control plane or the route to the virtual machine.
46.	Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit resources. These policies enforce different rules across all resource configurations so that the configurations stay compliant with corporate standards
47.	By using ARM templates, you can describe the resources you want to use in a declarative JSON format
48.	ARM templates define an application's infrastructure requirements for a repeatable deployment that is done in a consistent manner. A validation step ensures that all resources can be created in the proper order based on dependencies, in parallel and idempotent
49.	ARM is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in an Azure subscription. You use management features, such as access control, resource locks, and resource tags, to secure and organize resources after deployment.
50.	Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that allows you to monitor running applications, automatically detect performance anomalies, and use built-in analytics tools to see what users do on an app
51.	Service Health notifies you of Azure-related service issues, such as region-wide downtime.
52.	Resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts, are deployed and managed
53.	Management groups can be used in environments that have multiple subscriptions to streamline the application of governance conditions. Resource groups can be used to organize Azure resources. Administrative units are used to delegate the administration of Azure AD resources, such as users and groups. Accounts are used to provide access to resources
54.	Azure Blob storage is an object storage solution that you can use to store massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.
55.	A defence in depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advancement of an attack that aims to gain unauthorized access to data. The principle of least privilege means restricting access to information to only the level that users need to perform their work. A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm and exhaust an application's resources. The perimeter layer is about protecting an organization's resources from network-based attacks.
56.	Region pairs allow the replication of Azure resources across geographies to help ensure that a secondary region is available in case of any disaster at the primary region
57.	Virtual machines are software emulations of physical computers. They include a virtual processor, memory, storage, and networking resources. Virtual machines host an operating system, and you can install and run software just like on a physical computer.
58.	Service endpoints are used to expose Azure services to a virtual network, providing communication between the two. ExpressRoute is used to connect an on-premises network to Azure. NSGs allow you to configure inbound and outbound rules for virtual networks and virtual machines. Peering allows you to connect virtual networks together
59.	Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs in the cloud. It enables your users to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices such as Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux. It works with apps that you can use to access Remote Desktops and apps. You can also use most modern browsers to access Azure Virtual Desktop-hosted experiences.
60.	Azure Blob storage is an object storage solution that you can use to store massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data
61.	Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud with shares that are accessible by using Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Mounting Azure file shares is just like connecting to shares on a local network
62.	Low storage costs and unlimited file formats make blob storage a good location to store backups and archives. Blob storage can be reached from anywhere by using an internet connection. Azure Disk Storage provides disks for Azure virtual machines. Azure Files supports mounting file storage shares
63.	Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via industry-standard SMB and NFS protocols.
64.	Conditional Access is a tool that Azure AD uses to allow or deny access to resources based on identity signals, such as the device being used. SSO enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers. MFA is a process whereby a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. Hybrid identity solutions create a common user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location
65.	Azure RBAC allows you to assign a set of permissions to a user or group. Resource tags are used to locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners. Resource locks prevent the accidental change or deletion of a resource. Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing an application secrets in a single, central location.
66.	Azure AD Connect syncs user identities from an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain to Azure AD. Azure AD Connect  allows you to use features such as single sign-on (SSO), MFA, and self-service password reset (SSPR) in both systems. SSPR prevents users from using known compromised passwords
67.	Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform
68.	Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that allows you to monitor running applications, automatically detect performance anomalies, and use built-in analytics tools to see what users do on an app
69.	You can drill down to the affected services, regions, and details to show how an event will affect you and what you must do. Most of these events occur without any impact to you and will not be shown. In a rare case that a reboot is required, Azure Service Health allows you to choose when to perform the maintenance to minimize the downtime
70.	Each Azure region is always paired with another region within the same geography, such as US, Europe, or Asia, at least 300 miles away
71.	Region pairs allow the replication of Azure resources across geographies to help ensure that a secondary region is available in case of any disaster at the primary region
72.	Data Catalog –– This enables data discovery; Data Sharing –– This shares data within and between organizations. Data Estate Insights –– This accesses data estate health. Data Policy –– This governs access to data.
73.	An Azure RBAC role is applied to a scope, which is a resource or set of resources that the access applies to. Resource locks prevent the accidental change or deletion of a resource. Resource tags are used to locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners. Policies enforce different rules across resource configurations so that the configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.
74.	Cloud Shell is an interactive, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources. Users can then access Bash and PowerShell from within Cloud Shell. You can use Bash and PowerShell to create Azure virtual machines
