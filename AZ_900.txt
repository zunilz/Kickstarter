Cloud Concepts

  -Reliability
    -ability to recover from failures
    -Fault tolerance
    -geo replication
    -No single point of failure
  -Scalability
    -Horizontal
      -Scaling out, adding additional machines, resources/vms/containers
    -Vertical
      -Scaling up, increasing the power cpu/memory
  -Predictability
    -Performance - consistence experience regardless of traffic
    -Performance - Autoscaling, load balancing, high availability
    -Costs - No unexpected cost, track and forecast resource usage in real time, Azure provides analytics tool
  -Management
    -Security - sec of cloud env, patches, maintainance, network control
    -Governance - standardized env, regulatory req, audit for compliance
  -Manageability
    -Autoscalig, monitoring, template based deployments, 
  -Capital expenditure CapEx, Operational expenditure OpEx
  -Consumption plan
    -pay as you use

    -Serverless
      -Extreme PaaS, no need to manage server by ourselves, but servers are used inside
  -Shared Responsibility Model
    -as above in Iaas, PaaS, and Saas
  -Azure marketplace
    -has solutions and services from MS and partners.
    -certified by MS
    -saves time from rebuilding
  -Cloud Architecture
    -Private Cloud
      -Org IT dept is responsible for cloud not MS
      -Azure hosted in private Hardware
      -good in security but constly to maintain 
    -Public Cloud
      -Fully managed by provider
      -little control over services and infrastructure
    -Hybrid Cloud
      -helps to avoid disruptions
      -best of private and public cloud

Azure Architecture

  -Regions
    -set of datacenters close enough to each other so it doen't matter which data center handles the request
    -each region is paired
    -so failover to sec region is done
    -auto replication is done
    -one at a time is updated
  -Availability zones
    -Physical location with one or more data centers
    -each region has minimum 3 zones
  -Resource Groups
    -a resource can exists in only one RG
  -Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
    -Deployment and managent service for azure
    -resources will be consistence when ARM is used

Compute

  -VMs
    -No hardware
    -is IaaS
    -uses Azure blueprint to follow company guidelines
    -Scale sets
      -group of identical load balanced VMs
      -Auto scaling, large scale(upto 1000 vms)
      -On filure, shifts traffic
  -App services
    -Fully managed platform 
    -Servers, Network and storage and other services are managed by Azure
    -Web Apps
    -Web Apps for Containers
    -API Apps
  -Azure container instances
    -manage all dependencies of app in container itself
    -doesn't have components related to OS, so, no maintainance like VM
    -increased portability
    -Efficient - deployment, maintenance
    - Developed App -> App placed in Container -> Azure Container Instance
  -Kubernetes
    -Open source tool for orchestrating and managing many container images and applications 
    -AKS - managed service
    -Azure Container Regitry
      -Keep track of current valid container images
      -Manages files and artifacts for containers
      -Feeds container images to ACI and AKS
    -AKS Cluster -> Nodes -> Pod(s) -> group of Container
  -Functions
    -No maintainance, process or VMs
  -App Service
    -deploy Website, Web application or Web service

Network

  -Virtual Network (VNet)
    -Fundamental part of Azure which connects all resoucres and services
    -VNet addresses -> many Subnet addresses
    -Can scale VNet
    -VNet is in single region and single subscription
    -Can connect two VNets using load balancer, peering VNets or using  VPN gateway
  -Subnet
    -Can secure different subnets under VNets
  -VNet peering
    -Resource in separate Networks can communicate with each other.
  -Load Balancer
    -receives internet network traffic and uses IP address and/or port to tranfer the traffic to one of the VM 
    -distributes inbound flows that arrive on LB's frontend to banckend pool instances, according to rules and health probes.
    -Inbound flows
      -traffic from the internet or local network
    -Frontend
      -gatekeeper, access point for the load balancer. All traffic goes here first. Backend VMs see only one accepoint, that is front end.
    -Backend Pool
      -The VM instances receiving traffic
    -Rules and health probes
      -checks to ensure backend instance can receive the data
    -Scenarios
      -Internet traffic, internal networks, port forwarding, outbound traffic
  -Virtual Network Gateway
    -VNet has subnet gateways
  -VPN Gateway
    -used in hybrid model communication over the internet (need a tunnel here), Azure gateway subnet
    -VNet gateway + VPN = VPN Gateway
  -Application Gateway
    -Make routing decisions based on Http request like uri path or host headers
    -Same session traffic can be handled by multiple servers
    -higher level load balancer
    -Can scale up/down
    -has e2e enryption, can disable it too
    -zone redundancy
    -Multi-site hosting
  -CDN
    -protects backend from high loads by maintaining a edge node near to user region, cached for a period of time then refreshed
  -Express route
    -doesn't use public network
    
  Storage

    -Storage Account
      -unique azure namespace
    -Container
      -Ways to store data in Storage account
    -Blob
      -Storage account -> Container -> Blob
      -Types
        -Block 
          - upto 4.7 TB, made up of individually managed blocks of data
          - optimized for append operations
        -Page
          -8 TB, kind of virual hdd, any part of file could be accessed.
    -Disk
        -HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, Ultra Disk
    -File
        -Sharing, Resillient, Managed
        -On premise to Azure File
    -Archive
        -Lowest price to backup
    -Storage Redundancy
        -Minimum 3 copies od data is maintained in Azure 
        -Multiple redundancy options
          -different location scopes - single zone, multi zones, multi regions
          -Local Red Storage - LRS - 3 copies are stored in different server racks within same location, susceptible to failure in case of zone/region blackout
          -Zone R S - ZRS - 3 copies are stored in 3 different zones, protects against one zone blackout
          -Geo R S - GRS - 3 copies are maintained in 2 different regions
          -Geo Zone R S - GZRS - maximum redundancy - 3 copies are in 3 different avilability zones, can enable read access in secondary zone.
    -Moving data
        -AzCopy, Azure storage explorer, Azure file sync
    -Addional migration options
