ARM templates
  -can supply values to variables used inside template config
  -Idempotent
  -Reuse
Azure Advisor
  -used to save cost, have more security etc.
  -high availability

Cloud Concepts
  -Reliability
    -ability to recover from failures
    -Fault tolerance
    -geo replication
    -No single point of failure
  -Scalability
    -Horizontal
      -Scaling out, adding additional machines, resources/vms/containers
    -Vertical
      -Scaling up, increasing the power cpu/memory
  -Predictability
    -Performance - consistence experience regardless of traffic
    -Performance - Autoscaling, load balancing, high availability
    -Costs - No unexpected cost, track and forecast resource usage in real time, Azure provides analytics tool
  -Management
    -Security - sec of cloud env, patches, maintainance, network control
    -Governance - standardized env, regulatory req, audit for compliance
  -Manageability
    -Autoscalig, monitoring, template based deployments, 
  -Capital expenditure CapEx, Operational expenditure OpEx
  -Consumption plan
    -pay as you use
  -Cloud service models
    -IaaS 
      -Yes: Physical Infrastructure
      -No: OS
      -No: Network Controls
      -No: Identity and Directory
      -No: Application management
      -No: Information and Data
      -No: Devices and Accounts
      -No & servers, N/Ws, Storage
    -PaaS  
      -Yes: Physical Infrastructure
      -Yes: OS
      -Yes/Optional: Network Controls
      -Yes/Optional: Identity and Directory
      -No: Application management
      -No: Information and Data
      -No: Devices and Accounts
      -above + MW, Resources are virualized and can be eaily scaled uo or down, Tools(sec, datawarehouse) : App services, Cosmos DB
    -SaaS  
      -Yes: Physical Infrastructure
      -Yes: OS
      -Yes: Network Controls
      -Yes: Identity and Directory
      -Yes: Application management
      -No: Information and Data
      -No: Devices and Accounts
      -above + provide managed/rented service like office 365, managed and accesd over internet.
    -Serverless
      -Extreme PaaS, no need to manage server by ourselves, but servers are used inside
  -Shared Responsibility Model
    -as above in Iaas, PaaS, and Saas
  -Azure marketplace
    -has solutions and services from MS and partners.
    -certified by MS
    -saves time from rebuilding
  -Cloud Architecture
    -Private Cloud
      -Org IT dept is responsible for cloud not MS
      -Azure hosted in private Hardware
      -good in security but constly to maintain 
    -Public Cloud
      -Fully managed by provider
      -little control over services and infrastructure
    -Hybrid Cloud
      -helps to avoid disruptions
      -best of private and public cloud

Azure Architecture
  -Regions
    -set of datacenters close enough to each other so it doen't matter which data center handles the request
    -each region is paired
    -so failover to sec region is done
    -auto replication is done
    -one at a time is updated
  -Availability zones
    -Physical location with one or more data centers
    -each region has minimum 3 zones
  -Resource Groups
    -a resource can exists in only one RG
  -Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
    -Deployment and managent service for azure
    -resources will be consistence when ARM is used

Compute
  -VMs
    -No hardware
    -is IaaS
    -uses Azure blueprint to follow company guidelines
    -Scale sets
      -group of identical load balanced VMs
      -Auto scaling, large scale(upto 1000 vms)
  -App services
