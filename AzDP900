Non Relational DB
  -Key-value databases
  -Document DB
  -Coulmn family databases
  -Graph databases

Transactional data processing
  -Online Transactional Processing(OLTP)
    -CRUD operations). These operations are applied transactionally, in a way that ensures the integrity of the data stored in the database. 
To accomplish this, OLTP systems enforce transactions that support so-called ACID semantics
    -OLTP systems are typically used to support live applications that process business data - often referred to as line of business (LOB) applications
      -Atomicity
        -each tran is treated as a single unit which succeeds completely or fails completely
      -Consistency
        -trans can only take the data in the database from one valid state to another
      -Isolation
        -concurrent transactions cannot interfere with one another, and must result in a consistent database state
      -Durability
        -when trans has been committed, it will remain committed.

Test:


The Cassandra API is used for tabular data in a column-family storage. The Gremlin API is used for graph databases. MongoDB API stores data in the Binary JSON (BSON) format. Table is used to retrieve key-value pairs.
The Cassandra API is queried by using SQL. The MongoDB API is queried by using MongoDB Query Language (MQL). The Gremlin API is queried by using Graph. The Table API is queried by using OData and LINQ queries.

Normalization uses the least possible amount of storage. Normalization optimizes for updates, inserts, and deletes. Normalization does not optimize for complex reads and does not provide a mechanism for unstructured data.
Normalization is a process to reduce data duplication. This can be done by separating entities into their own tables and establishing relationships between the tables.
Creating an index allows you to search for data in a table more efficiently. A view is a virtual table based on the results of a SELECT query. It allows you to view specific rows in one or more tables. A stored procedure defines SQL statements that can be run on command.
A view, a function, and a stored procedure allow you to reuse the query definition for a complex query that selects data from multiple tables.
UPDATE and MERGE modify the existing data in a table. SELECT and INSERT do not affect the existing data in a table.

Azure SQL Database is a serverless platform as a service (PaaS) SQL instance. SQL Managed Instance is a PaaS service, but databases are maintained in the same SQL Managed Instance cluster. SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines running Windows or Linux are not serverless options.
Azure Synapse Analytics is fully managed but is not a relational database such as SQL.
Azure SQL Database allows you to provision a single database on a dedicated server and has on-demand scalability. SQL Managed Instance can support multiple databases, and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines is installed on a virtual machine, where each instance can support multiple databases.
SQL Edge is optimized for IoT scenarios that must work with streaming time series data. SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machinesis is best used when you want to retain control over the server and database configuration. SQL Managed Instance is ideal for cloud migrations where you need minimal change to existing apps. Azure SQL Database is best used for new cloud solutions.

A relational database is the best option for CRUD operations and uses the least amount of storage space. A key/value store is used for simple lookups based on a single key to obtain a single value. A document database uses unstructured data such as JSON, and is optimized for retrieval, not CRUD operations. A graph database is used to store hierarchical data, such as organizational charts that have nodes and edges.
Azure Cosmos DB has a SQL API that is optimized to store and process (transform) JSON files. The SQL API allows you to query the documents by using SQL-like language. There is no additional learning curve here to complete the task. Azure Files is used as storage for any type of file. There are no built-in methods to query the file and aggregate data. Blob storage allows you to store any type of data. You must use Azure Synapse Analytics or Azure Databricks to be able to query and aggregate the data. Azure SQL Database is a relational database that keeps data in tables. You must create a process that queries the JSON files and stores them in a relational format.
Time series databases are used to store sequential data. Table storage is not suited for time series. Graph databases are used to store hierarchical data, such as organizational charts that have nodes and edges. Azure SQL Database is the best option for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, uses the least amount of storage space, and is not optimized for time series.
Azure Cosmos DB allows you to store data as a graph database. Azure Synapse Analytics, SQL Managed Instance, and Azure SQL Database do not.

ORC and Parquet are columnar data formats. Avro is row-based, and CSV is used for delimited data.
Isolation in transactional data processing ensures that concurrent transactions cannot interfere with one another and must result in a consistent database state.
Live applications are used in transactional data processing systems. LOB applications are a type of live application that processes business data.
Database administrators maintain existing databases. Database engineers create databases. Database analysts use data from a database to make business decisions. Database users use a database.
A database administrator manages data security, implementing backup and recovery plans and monitoring the performance of database solutions. A data engineer manages data privacy, monitoring data stores and data pipelines. A data analyst is responsible for building data models, cleaning and transforming data, and finding hidden data patterns.

Data Factory is used to run ETL pipelines. Databricks is used for processing large amounts of data, which is supported by multiple cloud providers. HDInsight is used to process large amounts of data.
Databricks and the Spark pool in Azure Synapse Analytics run data processing for large amounts of data by using Scala.
Azure Synapse allows you to perform near real-time analytics on operational data. Databricks and HDInsight do not meet all the requirements. Data Lake Storage is a category of analytical data store.

Stream processing is fast. It processes data as it arrives. Stream processing executes simple analytics or simply writes data to a sink. Stream processing handles small chunks of data.
Batch processing is used to execute complex analysis. Batch processing handles a large amount of data at a time. Batch processing is usually measured in minutes and hours.

Data Lake Storage, Event Hubs, and IoT Hub are sources commonly used to ingest data for stream processing. Azure SQL Database and Azure Function are outputs.
Data Explorer is used for the analysis of large amounts of text log data, websites, and IoT devices and uses a common querying language. Data Lake Storage Gen2 is a data source, Azure Stream Analytics is used to define streaming jobs, apply a perpetual query, and write the results to an output. Azure Cosmos DB stores data.

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that adds support to Data Lake Storage for transactional consistency.

Scatter plots are used to determine a relationship or correlation between two numeric values. Pie charts visually compare different values as a proportion of a total. Line charts are used to examine trends, usually over time. Bar charts are used to compare different values for discrete categories.

Power BI Desktop is used to define analytical models. Phone App is used to view Power BI reports. Power BI Service is used to serve data. Data Factory is used to run ETL jobs.
To share data models and reports created in Power BI Desktop, they are first published to the Power BI service.

Data Lake Storage Gen2 is used for storing huge amounts of data to be processed by services such as Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and HDInsight. Page blobs are used for VHDs. 
Table storage is used for two dimensional tables. 
Azure Files is not optimized for large amounts of data to be processed by services such as HDInsight.
Azure Files is used to share files by using NFS and SMB. 
Data Lake Storage Gen2 is used for storing huge amounts of data to be processed, not to be shared among virtual machines. 
Page blobs are used for VHDs.

SQL is the native API in Cosmos DB. It manages data in the JSON format. The Cassandra API uses a column-family storage structure. The Table API is used to work with data in key/value tables. The Gremlin API is used with data in a graph structure.
Azure Cosmos DB allows you to aggregate data in analytical reports without additional development. Azure SQL Database does not store data in JSON files. Blob storage and Data Lake Storage do not allow you to aggregate data for analytical reports without additional development effort.

OLAP databases are used for snowflake schemas with historical data. Table storage is not suited for this type of data. Graph databases are used to store hierarchical data, such as organizational charts that have nodes and edges. OLTP databases are used for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, use the least amount of storage space, and are not for historical data in a snowflake schema.

Column-family databases are used to store unstructured, tabular data comprising rows and columns. Azure Synapse Analytics Spark pools do not directly support graph or relational databases.
Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin allows you to implement a non-relational database to model nodes and the relationships between them.

Analytical databases are highly denormalized to store large amounts of aggregated data and are optimized for reads. Time series workloads do not store large amounts of aggregated data. Graph workloads store hierarchical data. Transactional workloads are optimized for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations.

Generally speaking, data analytics comes in four types :
Descriptive, to answer the question : What’s happening?
Diagnostic, to answer the question: Why’s happening?
Predictive, to answer the question: What will happen?
Prescriptive, to answer the question: What actions should we take?
  -Predictive analytics, broadly speaking, is a category of business intelligence that uses descriptive and predictive variables 
    from the past to analyze and identify the likelihood of an unknown future outcome

Relational databases are optimized for writes. They are optimized for consistency and availability. Advantages of relational databases include simplicity, 
ease of data retrieval, data integrity, and flexibility.

Azure file shares are deployed into storage accounts, which are top-level objects that represent a shared pool of storage.
Azure Cosmos DB SQL API accounts provide support for querying items using the Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax.

A treemap chart divides the chart area into rectangles that represent the different levels and relative sizes of the data hierarchy.

Database normalization is the process of restructuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
Full normalisation will generally not improve performance, in fact it can often make it worse but it will keep your data duplicate free.

Analytics systems are deformalized to increase performance.
Transactional database systems are normalized to increase data consistency.
