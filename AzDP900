Non Relational DB
  -Key-value databases
  -Document DB
  -Coulmn family databases
  -Graph databases

Transactional data processing
  -Online Transactional Processing(OLTP)
    -CRUD operations). These operations are applied transactionally, in a way that ensures the integrity of the data stored in the database. To accomplish this, OLTP systems enforce transactions that support so-called ACID semantics
    -OLTP systems are typically used to support live applications that process business data - often referred to as line of business (LOB) applications
      -Atomicity
        -each tran is treated as a single unit which succeeds completely or fails completely
      -Consistency
        -trans can only take the data in the database from one valid state to another
      -Isolation
        -concurrent transactions cannot interfere with one another, and must result in a consistent database state
      -Durability
        -when trans has been committed, it will remain committed.

Data services in Azure
  -Azure SQL
    -Azure SQL DB

Azure No SQL
  -Azure blob storage
    -Storage account -> Blob Container -> blobs
    -Three types
      -Block blobs
      -Page blobs
      -Append blobs
    -Hot, Cool and Archive tiers
  -Azure Data lake
  -Azure Files
  -Azure Tables
    -Used for semi structured data
    -key value pair
    -Uses partion key and row key
    -If an application adds a new row to a table, Azure ensures that the row is placed in the correct position in the table.
  -Azure Cosmos DB
