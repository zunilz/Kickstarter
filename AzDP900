Transactional data processing
  -Online Transactional Processing(OLTP)
    -CRUD operations). These operations are applied transactionally, in a way that ensures the integrity of the data stored in the database. To accomplish this, OLTP systems enforce transactions that support so-called ACID semantics
    -OLTP systems are typically used to support live applications that process business data - often referred to as line of business (LOB) applications
      -Atomicity
        -each tran is treated as a single unit which succeeds completely or fails completely
      -Consistency
        -trans can only take the data in the database from one valid state to another
      -Isolation
        -concurrent transactions cannot interfere with one another, and must result in a consistent database state
      -Durability
        -when trans has been committed, it will remain committed.
